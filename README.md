 # About Dataset
 Given historical stock price data for Apple, Microsoft, Netflix and Google over the past three months, your task is to analyze and compare the performance of 
 these companies in the stock market using various data science techniques.
 Specifically, the goal is to identify trends and patterns in stock price movements, calculate moving averages and volatility for each company, and conduct correlation analysis to examine the relationships between different stock prices.
 You can also download the latest data using the finance API instead of using the provided dataset.
 Here’s a detailed guide on how to carry out a Market Analysis project using machine learning, including a step-by-step explanation and Python code example:
 # Project Overview
 Objective: To analyze market trends and predict future market behavior using machine learning techniques.
 # Steps to Follow:
 1. Define the Scope and Objective:
 ○ Identify the market or industry you want to analyze.
 ○ Define the specific objectives of your analysis (e.g., predicting market growth, understanding consumer behavior, etc.).
 2. Data Collection:
 ○ Gather relevant data from various sources (e.g., financial reports, market research reports, government databases, etc.).
 ○ Commondata points include market size, market share, growth rates, consumer demographics, competitive analysis, etc.
 3. Data Preparation:
 ○ Clean the data to remove any inconsistencies or errors.
 ○ Combine data from different sources into a single dataset.
 ○ Usetools like Pandas for data cleaning and preparation.
 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
 ○ Perform EDA to understand the data distribution and identify patterns.
 ○ Usevisualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize the data.
 5. Feature Engineering:
 ○ Create new features from existing data that might be useful for the machine
 learning model.
○ Normalize or standardize the data if necessary.
 6. Model Selection:
 ○ Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms based on the problem
 (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forest, etc.).
 ○ Split the data into training and testing sets.
 7. Model Training and Evaluation:
 ○ Train the machine learning model on the training set.
 ○ Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using appropriate metrics.
 8. Model Tuning and Optimization:
 ○ Tunethe model's hyperparameters to improve performance.
 ○ Usetechniques like cross-validation to ensure the model is not overfitting.
 9. Deployment:
 ○ Deploy the model using tools like Flask or Django for web applications.
 ○ Usethe model to make predictions on new data
